# bookbot
A Bookbot guided project from BootDotDev

BookBot is my first project!
This project is simplle and rather rudimentary. 
It takes a book in the form of a text file (.txt) and provides some statistics.
It displays word count as well as a character count for all aphabetical characters
and displays them in descending order of occurence.
